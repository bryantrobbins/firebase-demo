## Firebase demo

This is a simple test project with Firebase and a Javascript client.

I am tracking my own work in the Issues tab.


### Components

* Client: A Javascript client using Vue.js, providing a testbed for calling Firebase services. Current version is barely usable, adapted from https://github.com/CaptainYouz/vue-firebase-tutorial/blob/master/src/components/Hello.vue and https://github.com/lmiller1990/firestore-vue-chat
